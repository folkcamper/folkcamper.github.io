The Activist Public License v. 0.2 README.txt

Public licenses protect authors. Activist licenses protect authors and the
public at large.

In a nutshell: The APL is a public license that is eligible for use by
biological persons, small companies, and nonprofits excepting those involved
in political or national-scale religious activities. (small churches are OK)
Government and military use is also restricted.

There are those who work in information technology who’ve seen their work
perverted, and those who will. Having gone through that experience personally I
have been reluctant to release software that I’ve written, because I have no
interest in seeing my software used by parties who have poor impulse control. 
I believe that my responsibility extends beyond simply creating utility, but
also to participating in my society in a way that advances the interests of
mankind.

Cognitive dissonance is the disquiet one feels when their actions do not
conform to their beliefs.  This is often experienced as the anxiety you feel
before doing something that part of you regards as immoral (sometimes at the
request of an employer) and the regret felt after doing it.  Unfortunately
technology leverages the consequence of ones actions. What may have once been a
minor offense against a few people, can now effect whole cultures. Developers
can no longer release code into the wild in an careless way if they wish to
avoid cognitive dissonance.

Most public licenses boil down to pretty much one concept: “Please don’t be
a jerk with my product.”.

It is simple courtesy to give credit, and to not dump blame for your own
bugs on other people. Some licenses go further by forcing “in kind”
redistribution as a sort of public service system. However there are many, many
more ways to be a jerk with other peoples software. This is why APL goes beyond
that.

The idea behind the APL, is that small and medium organizations tend to be
dependent on their communities. This results in some regulation of their
behavior. Larger organizations have no such moral compass.  While we might wish
to exclude all “jerks” from using our software we cannot reasonably expect
to enumerate, or agree on who they might be. But we can prevent many of the
worst cases by licensing on the basis of scale.

Distribution of open source products tend to occur through a large number of
grass roots channels. Abusing society through software tends to be the domain
of larger organizations.  By differentiating between the two we may preserve
the administrative benefits of a public license, while avoiding the cognitive
dissonance that tends to come along with abusive and inconsiderate scaling of
ethically ambivalent technology.

This is not perfect by any means. Scale does not by itself indicate a
predisposition to amoral behavior. However there are fewer large organizations
than there are smaller ones. So the APL approach allows us to deal with the
most risky users on a case by case basis.

There are many intricacies of law that have been considered before taking
this approach, in particular the problem of “corporate personhood”.  It
is the authors belief that licensing based on scale, is the only practical
approach at this time.  Ultimately it comes down to discriminating based on
legally recognized concepts. The law is an exceedingly rickety and pliable
scaffold on which to hang reason. If a license is to remain aloft on its own,
the only practical means of supporting it is to find the few stout bolts the
law provides.

Thank you or taking the time to consider APL. The APL was derived in part
